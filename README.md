supybot IRC bot plugin to use with Dota2 Valve API

you will need to get a VALVE api key, you can do this here

http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey

then you need to have a mongodb installation to cache the data that you download from the Dota2 API (am tryint go be nice to valve)

Install
=======

Just copy the Dota2 folder on your supybot plugins directory as it is

then inside in the plugins.py file add your API key and your mongo user / password

Then load the plugin from the bot and use it :D


Usage
=====

For a list of commands just !list Dota2 from your bot and you'll figure it out

Some things (mostly output) are in spanish, this is something that I did for my friends that I chat with, and they also play dota.

it's not perfect, it's got some bugs but it works, this is also the initial commit so I will add more stuff to it (maybe) in the future
